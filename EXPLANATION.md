   - Better performance without manual memoization
   - Smarter re-rendering strategies

2. **Enhanced Hooks**
   - Improved useEffect behavior
   - Better state management
   - More efficient context usage

3. **Server Components**
   - Better integration with Next.js
   - Improved streaming capabilities
   - Enhanced hydration process

### Next.js 15.2.0 Features Utilized

1. **Turbopack**
   - Faster development server
   - Improved hot module replacement
   - Better TypeScript support

2. **App Router Improvements**
   - Enhanced server components
   - Parallel routes optimization
   - Improved caching mechanisms

3. **Image Component**
   - Latest optimizations for images
   - Better lazy loading support
   - Improved responsive handling

### Key Components

1. **AnimeGrid**
   - Handles the display of anime cards in a responsive grid
   - Implements loading skeletons for better UX
   - Uses Next.js Image for optimized image loading

2. **AnimeFilters**
   - Manages multiple filter options in a clean interface
   - Implements controlled form components
   - Provides immediate feedback on filter changes

3. **SearchBar**
   - Implements debounced search functionality
   - Shows loading state during API calls
   - Includes clear search functionality

### Data Management

1. **React Query Implementation**
   - Optimized for Next.js 15.2.0
   - Caching strategy:
     - List data: 5-minute stale time
     - Detail data: 5-minute stale time
   - Placeholder data for smooth transitions
   - Automatic background refetching

2. **TypeScript Types**
   - Comprehensive type definitions for API responses
   - Strict type checking for components
   - Interface segregation for better maintainability

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Next.js 15.2.0 Specific**
   - Leveraging Turbopack for faster development
   - Optimized server-side rendering
   - Enhanced static optimization
   - Improved client-side navigation

2. **Search Optimization**
   - 500ms debounce on search input
   - Automatic pagination reset on search
   - Cached results for recent searches

3. **Image Loading**
   - Responsive image sizing
   - Lazy loading for off-screen images
   - Priority loading for visible content

4. **State Management**
   - Local state for UI components
   - React Query for server state
   - Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Responsive Design

1. **Grid System**
   - 1 column on mobile
   - 2 columns on tablet
   - 4 columns on desktop

2. **Component Adaptations**
   - Flexible filter layout
   - Responsive image containers
   - Mobile-friendly navigation

### Future Improvements
